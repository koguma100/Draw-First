# Draw First!  A group drawing game

## Inspiration
Draw First is inspired by having fun with friends with art!
Gartic phone is a similar game we took inspiration from as well.

## What it does
Draw First is a pictionary game where users can create/join a lobby of maximum of 8 people. Hosts of the game can choose a category for the game like animals, food, places, and objects. Users will be able to input a lobby code and user to join a game, if the user/code is already taken then it'll warn the user. When joining a game users will be able to see other users. 

## How we built it
We built this project using node.js, react, html, css, websocket.

## Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges we ran into were how web sockets are used and how to save user data using a database. We had difficultly finding documentation for websocket integration into our project that worked, but eventually were able to troubleshoot the issues and make websocket connections

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Got the web sockets to work!
Created a responsive canvas in React, and overall learned more about React including states.

## What we learned
Fredy: I learned node.js, react, and how API's work in js.
Will: I gained a better understanding of React,  about how websocket works, and how to integrate the protocol into a React project for a sustained connection between server and client(s).

## What's next for Draw First
The next steps for Draw First would be:
- Communication between users
- Upload wordlist of categories
- Scoring system
- Combine backend to frontend in order to create multiple lobbies
